# LipMat
Matlab Script for automated LC-MS/MS lipid analysis

LipMat script is a set of tools for automated LC-MS/MS phospholipid analysis. More information here:
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsomega.9b03463

Scripts starting with P are for generating lipid libraries. Scripts starting with AA, AB, AC, and AD are core LipMat script, and they should be run in alphabetical sequence. More information is in header of each script. 

Theoretical and experimental fragmentation of PC, PE ,PS ,PI , PA, PG, SM and CL lipids is collected from the following literature:
